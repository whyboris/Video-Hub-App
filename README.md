## Development

‚ö† The repository is usually ahead of the publicly [released version](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/releases) - it is üöß WIP and may have bugs in it.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install (you may need to run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if install fails)
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version | Date      | Comment |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Angular          | v18     | Oct 2024  |         |
| Angular-CLI      | v18     | Oct 2024  |         |
| Electron         | v33     | Oct 2024  | (internally uses Node `v20.18.0` and Chromium 128) |
| Electron Builder | v25     | Oct 2024  |         |

- **Node**: It may be best to use the same version as _Electron_ uses internally (`v20.18.0`)

- **Angular CLI**: not required but may be useful: [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io).

- **Mac**: We now have `M1` and `Intel` builds, but you may need to manually update the _FFmpeg_ and _FFprobe_ executables if you're building for a different architecture than you are on.

To help debug a production build of VHA you can use [Debugtron](https://github.com/bytedance/debugtron)

## Remote

üë©‚ÄçüöÄ a new feature in VHA is the option for the user to turn on a _server_ after the app starts. This will let the user open a simpler version of the VHA user interface on their phone or tablet (if both PC and device are on the same WiFi) and use it as remote control to play videos üöÄ

For details, see [instructions](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/blob/master/remote/README.md).
