## Upcoming features

See [issues](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/issues) for what is in progress.


## Development

‚ö† The repository is usually ahead of the publicly [released version](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/releases) - it is üöß WIP and may have bugs in it.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version  | Date            | Comment                                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | v12.1.1  | July 2021       |                                                   |
| Angular-CLI      | v12.1.1  | July 2021       |                                                   |
| Electron         | v13.1.6  | July 2021       | (internally uses Node `v14.16.0` and Chromium 91) |
| Electron Builder | v22.11.7 | July 2021       |                                                   |

- **Node**: I recommend using the same version as _Electron_ uses internally, but any version 14 or above should work.

- **Angular CLI**: not required but may be useful: [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io).

To help debug a production build of VHA you can use [Debugtron](https://github.com/bytedance/debugtron)


## Remote

üë©‚ÄçüöÄ a new feature in VHA is the option for the user to turn on a _server_ after the app starts. This will let the user open a simpler version of the VHA user interface on their phone or tablet (if both PC and device are on the same WiFi) and use it as remote control to play videos üöÄ

For details, see [instructions](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/blob/master/remote/README.md).
