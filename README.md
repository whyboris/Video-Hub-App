## Development

âš  The repository is usually ahead of the publicly [released version](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/releases). Version `3.0.0` code is already on the `main` branch; while it is ðŸš§ WIP, it has bugs in it.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm electron` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version | Date        | Comment                                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | v10.0.0 | June 2020   |                                                   |
| Angular-CLI      | v10.0.0 | June 2020   |                                                   |
| Electron         |  v9.0.0 | June 2020   | (internally uses Node `v12.14.1` and Chromium 83) |
| Electron Builder | v22.7.0 | June 2020   |                                                   |

- **Node**: I recommend using the same version as _Electron_ uses internally, but version 10 or above should work.

- **Angular CLI**: not required but may be useful: [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io).
