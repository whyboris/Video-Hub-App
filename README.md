## Development

Main dependencies in use:

| Library     | Version | Date        | Comment |
| -------     | ------- | ----        | ------- |
| Angular     | v8.2.3  | August 2019 |         |
| Angular-CLI | v8.2.3  | August 2019 |         |
| Electron    | v7.1.9  | January 2020 | (internally uses Node v12.8.1 and Chromium 78) |
| Electron Builder | v22.2.0 | January 2020 |     |

- **Node**: likely any version of node (v10 or above) should work, but I recommend to use the same one _Electron_ does (`12.8.1`).
- **Angular CLI**: you'll need to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) to run the project (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).
